### Using in a page

Extend the Page class (or whatever class you want to use) whit the MailChimp extension:

```YAML
---
Name: mailchimp-extensions
---
Page:
  extensions:
    - MailChimp
```

Then render the $McSubscribeForm variable inside your template:

```
<% include SideBar %>
<div class="content-container unit size3of4 lastUnit">
	<article>
		<h1>$Title</h1>
		<div class="content">$Content</div>
	</article>
		$Form
		$PageComments
		$McSubscribeForm
</div>
```

### Using inside a widget

Simply use the MailChimpSubscribe widget as usual [documentation here](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-widgets)

### Using inside a widget with widget-pages-extension

Define the widgetareas in your pages, like stated in [widget-pages-extension module](https://github.com/g4b0/silverstripe-widget-pages-extension)
After that define which widget are allowed for your pages, in particular MailChimpSubscribe.

For example your Page.php will become

```php
class Page extends SiteTree {

	private static $db = array(
	);
	private static $has_one = array(
			'SideBar' => 'WidgetArea'
	);
	private static $allowed_widgets = array(
			'MailChimpSubscribe'
	);

}
```

Run a /dev/build?flush=all and enjoy your widgets. Due to a known issue in widget-pages-extension you have to save each page you will need to put the widgets on.
For more information about how to use the widgets please see the [widget-pages-extension module documentations](https://github.com/g4b0/silverstripe-widget-pages-extension)
